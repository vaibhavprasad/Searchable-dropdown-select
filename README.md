# Searchable-dropdown-select

It is a searchable selectable dropdown select and behaves almost in the same way as the youtube search works.  
It works with both keyboard and mouse.  
It is written in plain Javascript and ES6 template strings are used for constructing the DOM.  
     
The index.html file contains the minimal HTML to start the development.  
All the logic is present in the index.js file.  
The Services file contains the data.   
  
  
  
Pending Items:   
  -  Add onmouseout/ onmouseleave event when pointer exits the search list container.
  -  Integrate with some api-provider.
  -  Rafactoring code
  -  Beautification
